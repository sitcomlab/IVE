> TL;DR: Search, video and map previews have been added to the CREATOR

<!--more-->

Hi everyone,

this is a quick update on the development of the Immersive Video Environment. Since the last time many bugs have been fixed, a lot has been refactored and more features has been added to the **CREATOR**. One new addition is Search, which was implemented on the database-level. Furthermore previews for Videos and maps for Location coordinates have been added to the **CREATOR**. Please find some screenshots below.

The development of adjusting and rendering Overlays is still in progress, but will be completed soon by **Niklas Philippi** <a href="https://github.com/nPhil01" target="_blank" class="link"><i class="fa fa-github-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, who maintains the project by now. For more information about the current stand on this feature, check out the **overlays branch** on GitHub ([https://github.com/sitcomlab/IVE/commits/overlays](https://github.com/sitcomlab/IVE/commits/overlays)).
