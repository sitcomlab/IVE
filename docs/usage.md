# TL;DR

* Open a webbrowser and go to <http://localhost:5000>
* Open the **VIEWER** in a new tab (<http://localhost:5000/viewer>)
    * there is also a *dark-mode* for the demonstrations in the IVE: <http://localhost:5000/ive.html>
* Open the **REMOTE CONTROL APP** in a new tab or on your smartphone (<http://localhost:5000/remote>)
* In the remote app, select a Scenario from the list
* After that, select a starting location

Have fun!

# Viewer and Remote control

To see your results and experience the IVE, you need to use the Viewer
and the remote control. With the remote control, you select what should
be shown in the viewer. You need to open both at the same time.
In the remote control select the scenario, the start location and the video that should be
shown in the viewer. Now you can see your video in the viewer.
Furthermore, you have the possibility to switch overlays on and off.

# Manage Content
There are several ways to manage content.
The most simple way is to use the Creator, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/creator/) for a guide.
Other options are described in section [Import]({{ site.baseurl }}/import/).
